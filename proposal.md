# Side-Scrolling Platformer

## Repository
(https://github.com/ClaytonTaylorr/ANGM-2305_FinalProject#)

## Description
Building a 2D side-scrolling platformer in Python with Pygame. It's basically a concept to see how well I know python and how well I can implement simple mechanics and produce a mario-esque concept. It's an excuse to mess around with digital art and interactive stuff in a creative way.

## Features
- **Player Movement and Physics**
  - Implement responsive left/right movement and jumping with basic gravity and collision detection using Pygame.
- **Scrolling World**
  - Design multiple connected platforms where the camera follows the player as they move through a scrolling environment.
- **Collectibles and Score**
  - Add collectibles and power-ups that the player can collect, updating an on-screen score or status.

## Challenges
 *With scope in mind and I may not get to everything*
- Learning the Pygame library in more depth for managing sprites, collisions, and sound.
- Creating a smooth scrolling effect that follows the player across a large level.
- basic AI for enemies or hazards.

## Outcomes

**Ideal Outcome:**
- A complete side-scrolling game with multiple levels, enemies, sound effects, and working score system.

**Minimal Viable Outcome:**
- A single playable level where the player can jump, walk, avoid obstacles, and reach a goal.

## Milestones

- **Week 1**
  1. Set up the Python project and install Pygame.
  2. Create a basic window and player character with movement controls.

- **Week 2**
  1. Add jumping and gravity mechanics.
  2. Build a basic level layout with platforms.

- **Week 3**
  1. Implement screen scrolling based on player movement.
  2. Add collectibles and a basic HUD (score display).

- **Week 4**
  1. Add enemy sprites and simple AI behavior.
  2. Create win/lose conditions and a restart function.

- **Week 5 (Final)**
  1. Final level design polish, sound effects, and visual polish.
  2. Test and debug. Upload project and documentation to GitHub.
